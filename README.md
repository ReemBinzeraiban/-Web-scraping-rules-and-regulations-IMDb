### Introduction

IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.



### Problem Statement  

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is one of the world's most entertaining popular sources of movie, TV and celebrity content with over 100 million unique visitors each day.
IMDb has a huge collection of movie database which includes various   classification such as action, classic drama, horror and comedy
The idea of our project is to remove the data from IMDb and form an analysis that helps the data analyst or production company decide how to go about making a new movie, and the second is to create a model to predict the feelings of movies based on user opinions.
